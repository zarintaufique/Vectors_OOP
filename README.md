A **vector** is a quantity that has two independent properties. The properties of vectors are as follows:
1. Magnitude
2. Direction. 


Code in this repository gives an account of a vector class, with 3 dimensions. Concepts of OOP have been used to creat vector class objects in the main and perform operations such as magnitude, angle calculation etc.
